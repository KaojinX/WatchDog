For this script to work you need only instal shedule and main.py json will create itself + fill up gaps for you email\password and folder path inside script.
This script checks:

If script was already used by chcecking if json file exist or if files dictionary is empty. 

If file was changed from last check:
    if yes then will send mail to you want until schedule and checks again from last time
    else: will wait until next schedule

Script don't recognise changes from 1+ loop so if something was changed, mail was send, checked once more and nothing was changed from moment email sending then for script is no change.
